# Twitch Fullscreen Brightness
This user script allows you to easily adjust the fullscreen video brightness on [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/).
Simply scroll up and down with your mouse wheel to increase or decrease the video brightness on the fly.

## Features
* Supports light and dark theme
* Customizable brightness values
  * Default brightness when entering fullscreen
  * Brightness boundaries (lower/upper)
  * Adjustment step size
* Overlay during brightness change (can be disabled in the settings)
* Localized settings dialog (currently English and German)
* Persisted settings

## Notes
Settings are accessible from Firefox toolbar via `Greasemonkey` > `User script commandsâ€¦`.

Even though the settings are themed to match the native Twitch user interface appearance,
_Twitch Fullscreen Brightness_ is neither developed, maintained nor affiliated with Twitch.
